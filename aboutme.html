    I am Naseer Ahmed Arsalan, a student of Information Technology. 
        I have good photography skills which I think would be helpful 
        for me in this course. I also have some basic knowledge of design 
        and I have practiced it on Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. 
        Figma is a new platform for me and it seems very interesting.
        In this course my hope is to understand design principles, 
        color theory, typography, and layout that can help create visually 
        appealing websites. I have a little knowledge about HTML/CSS but proficiency 
        in these languages allows me for structuring and styling web pages effectively.
        According to my knowledge, a web design course can provide structured 
        education and hands-on experience to enhance design skills or learn new ones.
        It often covers topics such as design principles, HTML/CSS, UX design,
        responsive design, and accessibility. Furthermore, this course may offer 
        opportunities to work on real-world projects, develop a design portfolio, 
        and collaborate with other students, which can be valuable for building experience 
        and networking opportunities in the industry.
